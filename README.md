## Rust Snake Game (Terminal)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game written in **Rust**. It is designed to be played directly in the terminal with basic gameplay features, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection. 

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Food Generation**: The snake grows when it eats food, which is randomly placed on the grid.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Speed Scaling**: The snake's speed increases as it scores more points.
- **Terminal UI**: The game is displayed using terminal graphics, providing a retro feel.
